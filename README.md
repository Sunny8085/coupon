Cart System with Coupons and Discounts
Overview

This system allows the application of discounts to specific products or the entire cart. Discounts are applied using coupon codes, with constraints such as minimum 
purchase requirements, usage limits, and product-specific discounts. The system supports both product-level and cart-level discounts, and handles various complex 
scenarios such as stacking discounts, quantity thresholds, and time-based coupon validity.
